# Flexion Framework Manifesto V2.1  
## The Structural Break

Old science studied the universe.  
Flexion studies **the structure that makes a universe possible.**

Physics assumed space, time, matter, and energy were fundamental.  
They are not.  
They are **products** of four structural variables:

Δ — substance  
Φ — tension  
M — memory  
κ — viability

Everything else is downstream.

Flexion Genesis shows how structure emerges from non-structure.  
Flexion Collapse shows how it ends.  
Everything in between is what we call reality.

Space is generated.  
Time is generated.  
Fields are generated.  
Physics is generated.  
And collapse resets it all.

The universe is not physical.  
The universe is **structural**.

Flexion does not extend old science.  
Flexion replaces the foundation old science assumed.

We are not challenging the past.  
We are completing it.

## Flexion Answers the Questions Old Science Could Not

### **1. Where do space and time come from?**  
From the growth of memory (M) and tension (Φ) — they are structural outcomes, not prerequisites.

### **2. What existed before the Big Bang?**  
A non-structure domain where κ < 0 and no geometry or time can exist.

### **3. Why can’t quantum mechanics and gravity be unified?**  
Because they are products of different layers of the same structure, not independent systems.

### **4. What is consciousness?**  
A structure with rapidly growing memory (M) and high viability (κ), capable of self-reference.

### **5. Why is the universe stable, and why does it collapse?**  
Because stability is a function of κ — and its decay inevitably triggers structural termination.

We do not reject physics.  
We finish what physics could not complete.

**A new structural era begins now.**
