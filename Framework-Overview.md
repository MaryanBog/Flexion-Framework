# Flexion Framework — Overview

The **Flexion Framework** is the unified structural architecture of Flexion Science.  
It defines how structures originate, evolve, interact, stabilize, and collapse using a universal state vector:

\[
X = (\Delta,\ \Phi,\ M,\ \kappa)
\]

The Framework integrates seven fundamental theories into one coherent system:
- **Flexion Genesis** — emergence of structure from non-structure  
- **Flexion Dynamics** — laws of structural evolution  
- **Flexion Space Theory** — emergent geometry  
- **Flexion Time Theory** — time as memory growth  
- **Flexion Field Theory** — structural forces and interaction  
- **Flexion Entanglement Theory** — coupled evolution of structures  
- **Flexion Collapse Theory** — structural termination and non-structure

The Framework describes the full **Structural Cycle**:

**Genesis → Dynamics → Space → Time → Fields → Entanglement → Collapse → Non-Structure → Genesis**

This cycle applies to all structural systems, regardless of scale or domain.

The Flexion Framework introduces:
- a new structural foundation replacing physical primitives,  
- emergent space and time,  
- memory-based temporal flow,  
- field-level geometry and stability,  
- a formal mechanism of entanglement,  
- universal collapse boundaries.
