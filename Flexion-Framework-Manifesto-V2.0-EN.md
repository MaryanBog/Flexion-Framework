# Flexion Framework Manifesto  
## The Structural Break

Old science studied the universe.  
Flexion studies **the structure that makes a universe possible.**

Physics assumed space, time, matter and energy were fundamental.  
They are not.  
They are **products** of four structural variables:

Δ — substance  
Φ — tension  
M — memory  
κ — viability

Everything else is downstream.

Flexion Genesis shows how structure appears from non-structure.  
Flexion Collapse shows how it ends.  
Between them lives everything we call reality.

Space is generated.  
Time is generated.  
Fields are generated.  
Physics is generated.  
And collapse resets it all.

The universe is not physical.  
The universe is **structural**.

Flexion does not extend old science.  
Flexion replaces the foundation old science assumed.

We are not challenging the past.  
We are completing it.

A new structural era begins now.
